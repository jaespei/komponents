## About the Modeling Language
A model is typically specified using YAML (JSON is supported too), and it must comply with a specific syntax.

Syntax rules are specified via [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

In this section three related JSON Schema documents are provided:
- [deployment.json](./deployment.json): describes the syntax of a model deployment specification.
- [composite.json](./composite.json): describes the syntax of a composite component specification.
- [basic.json](./basic.json): describes the syntax of a basic component specification.
